In order to use this language DLL, you need to copy
LDView-English (United States).dll and Help.html into the directory on your
computer where you installed LDView.

If your computer's language isn't set to English (United States), you can use
LDView-EnglishUS.reg to force LDView to use LDView-English (United States).dll
as its language DLL.  Simply double click on LDView-EnglishUS.reg, and answer
Yes to any questions that are asked.  If you later want to reset LDView so that
it will use the default language, just double click on
LDView-DefaultLanguage.reg and answer Yes to the questions.
