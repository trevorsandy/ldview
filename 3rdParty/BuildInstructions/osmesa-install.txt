osmesa-install:

Script and patches to build and install variations of OSMesa http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html:
- choice of osmesa driver: swrast, softpipe, llvmpipe or swr (SWR is not yet supported on macOS)
- possibility to also compile and install LLVM 4.0.0 or 3.4.2 for the llvmpipe driver
- "mangled" or not (in mangled OSMesa, all functions start with mgl instead of gl)
- debug or not

Usage:

- Download git repository from https://github.com/trevorsandy/mesa-install.git
- edit variables / paths as the beginning of the osmesa-install.sh  script
- compile and install:

mkdir build
cd build
sh ../osmesa-install.sh

- there is a test program on the osdemo directory, with a few checks
